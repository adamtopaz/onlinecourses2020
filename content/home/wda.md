## Registering for a PIMS digital course via the Western Deans' Agreement

In order to register in a PIMS digital course for the Western Deans' agreement
you must obtain the approval of the course instructor.  Once you have obtained
their approval please complete the <a target="_blank"
href="http://wcdgs.ca/content/dam/ex/wcdgs/Western-Deans-Agreement.pdf">Western
Deans' agreement form <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.
The exact process and deadlines vary by site, but the general steps for student
at PIMS member universities are

1. Contact your home department and obtain the necessary signatures.
1. Contact the PIMS Site administrator at your home site.
1. The PIMS Site Admin from your university will liaise with "outgoing" contact
   at their university and Site Admin at host university to make sure form is
   transferred.
1. The PIMS Site Admin at host university will liaise with "incoming" contact at
   their university and make sure that complete documentation has been received
   from the student
1. Once student is accepted, host the PIMS Site Admin will be available to
   assist students with obtaining waivers and paying necessary fees (or
   referring them to the appropriate "incoming" contact).
1. After course completion, the host site PIMS Admin will be available to assist
   student with ordering of transcripts (or referring them to the appropriate
   "incoming" contact).

A list of PIMS Site administrators and other information is given below,
contacts for other sites can be found on the <a target="_blank"
href="http://wcdgs.ca/contact-us.html">Western Deans' Agreement contact page <i
class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. Note that: The Western Deans'
Agreement provides an automatic tuition fee waiver for visiting students.
Graduate students paying normal required tuition fees at their home institution
will not pay tuition fees to the host institution. However, students will
typically be required to pay other ancillary fees to the host institution (as
much as $270) or explicitly request exemptions (e.g. Insurance or travel fees).

Select your university and the university hosting the course you are interested
in below. Read both sets of instructions _carefully_ before proceeding.
