## Registering for a PIMS digital course via the Western Deans' Agreement

In order to register in a PIMS digital course for the Western Deans' agreement
you must obtain the approval of the course instructor.  Once you have obtained
their approval please complete the <a target="_blank"
href="http://wcdgs.ca/content/dam/ex/wcdgs/Western-Deans-Agreement.pdf">Western
Deans' agreement form <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.
The completed form should be returned to your graduate advisor who will sign it
and take the required steps. For students at PIMS sites, a list of graduate
advisors is given below, contacts for other sites can be found on the <a
target="_blank" href="http://wcdgs.ca/contact-us.html">Western Deans' Agreement
contact page <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. Note that: The
Western Deans' Agreement provides an automatic tuition fee waiver for visiting
students. Graduate students paying normal required tuition fees at their home
institution will not pay tuition fees to the host institution. However, students
will typically be required to pay other ancillary fees to the host institution
(as much as $270) or explicitly request exemptions (e.g. Insurance or travel
fees).

  in-instructions="Complete application form and obtain all 4 signatures. Submit form to UA department. By signing the WDA form, the student's home department is providing written assurance that the course(s) listed on the form: (a) is not available at the home university; (b) is required for the student's program; and (c) will be credited toward the student's graduate degree program upon successful completion."

  in-notes-1="The University of Alberta does not place restrictions on the number of courses that may be taken under the WDA; however, the FGSR at the University of Alberta reserves the right to limit that number. **Before applying, it is the student's responsibility to ensure that the course(s) the student wishes to take will be recognized as part of the graduate degree program by their home University**. If acceptable to the home University, the courses can be taken as audits."
  in-notes-2="**For each course requested under the WDA, authorized signatures from the department(s) offering the course(s) at the University of Alberta are needed**. The department is under no obligation to accept a student into a particular course."
  in-notes-3="For courses taken at the University of Alberta, **students will be assessed only Non-Instructional fees by the University of Alberta**. If a course requires additional expenses under University of Alberta policy, the department will require that the student pay these.  Fees are <span>$</span>484.43 for Fall, <span>$</span>216 for Summer and cannot be waived."
  out-instructions="Complete application form and obtain all 4 signatures. Submit form to host department. By approving the WDA application, the department at the University of Alberta is certifying that the course(s) listed on the form: (a) is not available at the University of Alberta; (b) is required for the student's program; and (c) will be credited to the student's graduate degree program upon successful completion with a satisfactory grade."

  out-notes-1="**All the requirements and course prerequisites of the university where the student plans to take the course(s) must be met**. The university where the student plans to take the course(s) is under no obligation to accept a student into a particular course and that university may restrict the number of courses which a student may take under the WDA."
  out-notes-2="**For thesis-based master's and doctoral students, up to two half-course equivalents (six units of course weights) may be taken under the WDA**. No more than two half-course equivalents will be considered since the policy of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR) provides for the transfer credit of a maximum of two half-courses or equivalent into a University of Alberta thesis-based graduate degree program. Courses taken under the WDA are counted toward the two half-course limit for transfer credit."
  out-notes-3="**For course-based master's students, up to one-third of a course-based master's program may be met through transfer credit or course exemption or a combination of both**, if recommended by the department and approved by the FGSR. Therefore the number of courses a student is eligible to take under the WDA depends on meeting this requirement and prior approval of the department and the FGSR."
  out-notes-4="**For each term of study under the WDA, the student will register at the University of Alberta in an Exchange (EXCH) course**, which will be equivalent to the course weight registration at the university where the student is taking the course(s). **The student will be assessed fees for that EXCH course at the University of Alberta**. In accordance with the provisions of the WDA **the student will be assessed general student fees, but no regular instructional fees by the university where the course(s) are being taken**. If a course requires additional expenses, the university may require the student to pay these additional expenses."
  out-notes-5="Upon completion of the course(s), **students shall arrange for official transcripts to be sent to their department at the University of Alberta and request that the department submit a Recommendation for Transfer Credit to the FGSR.**"
