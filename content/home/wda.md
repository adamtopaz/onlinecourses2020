The Western Deans' Agreement provides an automatic tuition fee waiver for
visiting students. Graduate students paying normal required tuition fees at
their home institution will not pay tuition fees to the host institution.
However, students may be required to pay other ancillary fees to the host
institution, or explicitly request exemptions from some items (e.g. Insurance
or travel fees).  For help with completing the Western Deans' agreement form,
please contact the graduate advisor at your institution.
