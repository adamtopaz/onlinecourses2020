## Registering for a PIMS digital course via the Western Deans' Agreement

In order to register in a PIMS digital course for the Western Deans' agreement
you must obtain the approval of the course instructor.  Once you have obtained
their approval please complete the <a target="_blank"
href="http://wcdgs.ca/content/dam/ex/wcdgs/Western-Deans-Agreement.pdf">Western
Deans' agreement form <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.
The completed form should be returned to your graduate advisor who will sign it
and take the required steps. For students at PIMS sites, a list of graduate
advisors is given below, contacts for other sites can be found on the <a
target="_blank" href="http://wcdgs.ca/contact-us.html">Western Deans' Agreement
contact page <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. Note that: The
Western Deans' Agreement provides an automatic tuition fee waiver for visiting
students. Graduate students paying normal required tuition fees at their home
institution will not pay tuition fees to the host institution. However, students
will typically be required to pay other ancillary fees to the host institution
(as much as $270) or explicitly request exemptions (e.g. Insurance or travel
fees).
