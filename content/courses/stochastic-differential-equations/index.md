  This is a one semester three credit hour course and meet twice a week,
  tentatively Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11:00-12:20. It is about the theory and
  applications of stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motion. The
  stochastic differential equations have found applications in finance, signal
  processing, population dynamics and many other fields. It is the basis of some
  other applied probability areas such as filtering theory, stochastic control and
  stochastic differential games. To balance the theoretical and applied aspects
  and to include as much audience as possible, we shall focus on the stochastic
  differential equations driven only by Brownian motion (white noise). We will
  focus on the theory and not get into specific applied area (such as finance,
  signal processing, filtering, control and so on). We shall first briefly
  introduce some basic concepts and results on stochastic processes, in particular
  the Brownian motions. Then we will discuss stochastic integrals, Ito formula,
  the existence and uniqueness of stochastic differential equations, some
  fundamental properties of the solution. We will concern with the Markov
  property, Kolmogorov backward and forward equations, Feynman-Kac formula,
  Girsanov formula. We will also concern with the ergodic theory and other
  stability problems. We may also mention some results on numerical simulations,
  Malliavin calculus and so on.
