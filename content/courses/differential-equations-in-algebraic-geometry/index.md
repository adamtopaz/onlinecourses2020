# Course Abstract

abstract: |
  What can differential equations tell us about the solutions to systems of
  algebraic equations? Conversely, what are the special properties of differential
  equations, and their solutions, that “come from geometry”?
  
  In this course, we will combine tools from both algebra and analysis in our
  concrete introduction to transcendental algebraic geometry. This includes the
  theory of differential forms and integration on families of algebraic curves,
  complex surfaces, and even Calabi-Yau threefolds. Along the way we will present
  the general theory of Fuchsian differential equations, their isomonodromic
  deformations, and associated completely integrable Pfaffian systems. Techniques
  of computation will be emphasized along with the theory.

  ### Textbooks
  Course notes and excerpts from classic papers; For general differential
  equations content, the excellent new textbook "[Linear Differential Equations
  in the Complex Domain: From Classical Theory to
  Forefront](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030546625)" by Yoshishige
  Haraoka (Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Volume 2271).
  
  ### Course grade
  The course grade will be based on a research project/paper, tuned to each
  student’s background and interests, that will be completed during the term in
  consultation with the professor.
