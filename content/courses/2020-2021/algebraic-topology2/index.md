# Course Abstract

abstract: |
  This is a basic level graduate course with introduction to algebraic topology
  and its applications in combinatorics, graph theory and geometry.  The course
  will cover introductory chapters from [1] and parts of [2].  With a guest
  lecture by Nati Linial from Israel, we will also touch some recent topics like
  the topology of random simplicial complexes.  The instructor expects that
  students with interests in topology and those with interests in discrete
  mathematics and geometry would find the course suitable.

  This is a basic level graduate course with introduction to algebraic topology
  and its applications in combinatorics, graph theory and geometry. The course
  will start with a brief review of the basic notions of topology, including the
  notions mentioned as prerequisites. It will continue with introductory
  chapters from Hatcher's textbook [1]. Simplicial complex.  Cell complex.
  Homotopy and fundamental group (Sections 1.1-1.3 and 1.A).  Homology (Sections
  2.1-2.2 and parts of 2.A-2.C). The second part of the course will concentrate
  on various applications of algebraic topology in combinatorics, graph theory,
  and geometry. We will follow relevant chapters from Matousek's book [2]. Some
  of those applications use Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, which will be covered first.
  Time permitting, we may touch a recent flourishing topics on the topology of
  random simplicial complexes.

prerequisites:
  - Topological spaces
  - Continuous maps
  - Metric space topology
  - Quotient topology
  - Compactness
  - Basic notions about simplicial complexes, fundamental groups and covering spaces will be helpful, but students will also be given opportunity to self-study about these notions during the first month of the course and help will be offered during tutorials.

#### Course Delivery
The weekly schedule will consist of four 50-minute lectures. Two
to three of them will be giving new material, with some details left for the
students to cover by themselves from the provided textbooks. The remaining
weekly time will be used for tutorials, covering problems and examples,
explaining details of proofs, and having students work in small groups and
report on their solutions. The online platform used will be Zoom, with
synchronous teaching that will be recorded for asynchronous viewing. 

#### Grading Scheme
 * Homework 20%
 * Midterm 30% 
 * Final 50% 

The instructor reserves the right to limit the number of students from outside
of SFU. He will allow for additional students who will not take the course for
credit (their homework and exams will not be graded).
