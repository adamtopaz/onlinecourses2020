prerequisites:
  - An undergraduate degree in mathematics and basic programming skills (you are
    comfortable programming with arrays and loops and writing subroutines).  Or
    an undergraduate degree in computer science and an  algebra course (in
    groups or rings and fields, or number theory).
abstract: >
  A course on algorithms for algebraic computation and tools for computing with
  multivariate polynomials, polynomial ideals, exact linear algebra, and
  algebraic numbers.  Tools include the Fast Fourier Transform, Groebner bases,
  and the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma.  We will use Maple as a calculator and as a
  programming language  to implement algorithms.  Instruction in Maple usage and
  programming will be provided.
