  Spectral methods are numerical methods for solving PDEs. When the solution is
  analytic, the convergence rate is exponential. The first part of this course
  gives an introduction to spectral methods. The emphasis is on the analysis of
  these methods including truncation and interpolation error estimates, and
  condition number estimates. The second part of the course focuses on fast
  algorithms for orthogonal polynomials. These algorithms leverage
  data-sparsities that are present in many of the problems when solved by
  orthogonal polynomial expansions.
