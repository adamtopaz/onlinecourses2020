abstract: >
  The space of probability distributions with finite second moments can be made
  into a natural metric space, called the Wasserstein space, whose metric is
  defined by using the optimal transportation between probability distributions.
  On this metric space one can draw curves that represent motion along the
  steepest descent (AKA gradient flow) of functionals of probability measures.
  This is a very fruitful way to view many important families of probability
  measures that arise from PDEs and stochastic processes. For example, using
  this geometric framework, one may derive functional inequalities and infer
  rates of convergence of Markov processes. A striking example is that of the
  heat equation, whose solution can be interpreted as the family of marginal
  distributions of Brownian motion. In the Wasserstein space, this curve of
  probability laws is the gradient flow of the Shannon entropy.

  
  We will discuss the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows, including the formal
  Riemannian calculus due to Otto, and the modern techniques of metric measures
  spaces. Apart from the classical examples, we will also discuss many modern
  variations such as Wasserstein mirror gradient flows that come up in
  statistical applications. A fruitful interaction between probability,
  geometry, and PDE theory will be developed simultaneously.

  This is a continuation of the sequence of OT+X courses under the Kantorovich
  Initiative.
