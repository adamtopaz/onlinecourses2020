  Introduction to the algebraic invariants that distinguish topological spaces.
  Focuses on the fundamental group and its applications, and homology.
  Introduction to the basics of homological algebra.
  
  This course introduces the algebraic invariants that distinguish topological
  spaces. The course will focus on the fundamental group and its applications
  and homology. Students will also learn the basics of homological algebra. Over
  the last few decades, algebraic topology has developed many applications to
  data science, materials science, and robotics. Whenever possible, connections
  to these emerging research fields will be discussed.
