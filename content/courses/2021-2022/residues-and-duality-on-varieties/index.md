  A gentle version of Grothendieck duality, but a little more sophisticated than
  Serre duality on projective varieties, with the role of residues and
  differential forms being given prominence.

  Let k be a perfect field. The aim would be to show that the sheaf of regular
  differentials on a (not necessarily smooth) k-variety V—a vast generalization of
  Rosentlicht’s differentials on curves— is a dualizing sheaf on V. Residues play
  a critical role, and in this somewhat non-intimidating setting, the role of
  residues, as well of fundamental class can be examined as toy models for the
  more sophisticated theory of Grothendieck, Deligne, Verdier, Lipman, Neeman. If
  time permits, we will show how these techniques apply to the “relative
  situation” of an equidimensional map f:X→Y between schemes. The principle
  reference is J. Lipman, Dualizing sheaves, differentials and residues on
  algebraic varieties, Asterisque 117.
