  The objective of this course is to study Optimal Portfolio Theory in discrete
  time and continuous time.  It would be interesting to those students who want
  to see how Probability Theory, Stochastic Processes, Stochastic Analysis,
  Control Theory, and Optimization Theory, can be applied to model and solve
  problems in Portfolio Management.

  ### Topics:
  * Optimal Portfolios in Single Period Models.
  * Mean-Variance Analysis.
  * Financial Markets in Discrete Time.
  * Optimal Portfolios in Discrete-Time Models.
  * Review of Stochastic Calculus.
  * Financial Markets in Continuous Time.
  * Optimal Portfolios in Continuous-Time Models.
