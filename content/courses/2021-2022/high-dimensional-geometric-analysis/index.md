  Asymptotic Geometric Analysis (AGA) lies at the border between geometry and
  analysis stemming from the study of geometric properties of finite dimensional
  normed spaces, especially the characteristic behavior that emerges when the
  dimension is suitably large or tends to infinity. Time permitting we plan to
  cover Banach-Mazur distance between convex bodies; John’s theorem; Dvoretsky’s
  theorem; properties of sections and projections of convex bodies;
  $MM^*$-estimate; M-ellipsoids, volumetric, entropic, and probabilistic methods
  for finite-dimensional convex bodies.
  We will also discuss methods of Fourier analysis in convex geometry.
  The idea of this approach is to express certain geometric quantities
  (such as sections or projections of convex bodies) in terms of the
  Fourier transform and then apply methods of harmonic analysis to solve geometric
  problems. In particular, we will talk about the following topics: the Fourier
  transform and sections of convex bodies; the Busemann-Petty problem; the Fourier
  transform and projections of convex bodies; Shephard’s problem; extremal
  sections of $l_p$-balls.
