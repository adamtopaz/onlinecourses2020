abstract: |
  In the second installment of OT+X series we take X=ML or machine learning. A
  number of problems equivalent or related to the Monge-Kantorovich Optimal
  Transport (OT) problem have appeared in recent years in machine learning, and
  data science at large. The fruitful connections between the two fields have led
  to several important advances impacting both. The Wasserstein metric defines a
  metric between probability measures, used to describe distributions over data or
  distributions over models, that improves upon existing metrics based on
  Hilbertian metrics and f-divergences, and that is now more easily amenable to
  efficient numerical computation.

  The first part of the course will cover the mathematical basics of OT and
  introduce the geometry of Wasserstein spaces. The second part of the course will
  cover computational aspects of OT and describe the central role played by OT in
  convergence analysis of stochastic algorithms for deep learning, in
  distributionally robust statistical learning, and in combinatorial or
  geometrical problems arising in data science applications. The course is meant
  for a wide audience including graduate students and industry professionals.
  Prior knowledge of real analysis, probability, statistics, and machine
  learning will be particularly helpful. The course will be interspersed
  with numerical illustrations. Familiarity with coding in Python or R is a
  plus.
