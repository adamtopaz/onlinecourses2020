  This course will cover measure theoretic probability with applications to
  statistics, including measure theory, measurable functions and random
  variables, expectation and integration, product spaces, independence,
  derivatives, conditional probability, characteristic functions, and limit
  theorems. The material is based on a course that has been taught to students
  in statistics, mathematics, engineering and science for many years. While
  rigorous proofs are discussed, the emphasis is on developing an understanding
  of how measure theory is used as a model for probability theory and how
  probability theory is used as a physical model. The statistics applications
  are used to motivate the development.  Because it emphasizes foundations, it
  is paced differently than a common graduate probability theory course, e.g.,
  covers more measure theory, and because it covers probability, it is different
  than a standard measure theory course.

  The plan is to have recorded videos for the longer proofs. Instead of covering
  proofs in class, I will trim the class time by the length of the videos of
  proofs of theorems covered in a class and then answer questions about the
  proofs in the next class. This lets the students go through the proofs at a
  speed and level of detail that they like but maintains the total time allotted
  to lectures and still getting to ask questions. 

  Course work will be based on homework assignments given out every 1.5-2 weeks
  (so about 7-9 total). I have a resubmission policy in which I let students
  resubmit selected problems based on feedback received from the first
  submission.
