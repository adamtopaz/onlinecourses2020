  Despite the extraordinary advances in computing technology, we continue to need
  ever greater computing power to address important fundamental scientific
  questions. Because individual compute processors have essentially reached their
  performance limits, the need for greater computing power can only be met through
  the use of parallel computers. This course is intended for students who are
  interested in learning how to take advantage of high-performance computing with
  the focus of writing parallel code for processor-intensive applications to be
  run on local clusters, the cloud, or shared infrastructure such as that provided
  by Compute Canada. Extensive use of pertinent and practical examples from
  scientific computing will be made throughout.  Allowable programming languages
  include Julia, Matlab, Maple, sage, python, Fortran, or C/C++. Various paradigms
  of parallel computing will be covered via the OpenMP, MPI, and OpenCL libraries.
  By the end of the course, students will be expected to be able to correctly
  solve non-trivial problems involving parallel programming as well as appreciate
  the issues involved in solving such problems.
