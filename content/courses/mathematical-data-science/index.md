 A large variety of data science and machine learning problems use graphs to
 characterize the structural properties of the data. In social networks, graphs
 represent friendship among users. In biological networks, graphs indicate
 protein interactions. In the World Wide Web, graphs describe hyperlinks between
 web pages. In recommendation systems, graphs reveal the economic behaviors of
 users. Unlike the one-dimensional linear data sequence, data appearing in the
 form of a graph can be viewed as a two-dimensional matrix with special
 structures. How to compress, store, process, estimate, predict, and learn such
 large-scale structural information are important new challenges in data
 science. This course will provide an introduction to mathematical and
 algorithmic tools for studying such problems. Both information-theoretic
 methods for determining the fundamental limits as well as methodologies for
 attaining these limits will be discussed. The course aims to expose students to
 the state- of-the-art research in mathematical data science, statistical
 inference on graphs, combinatorial statistics, among others, and prepare them
 with related research skills.

 * Random graphs (basic notions in graph theory, Erdös–Rényi graph, threshold
 phenomenon)
 * Tools from the probabilistic method (first and second moment method, the
 method of moments)
 * Vertex degrees (degree distribution, graph isomorphism algorithm
 * Connectivity
 * Small subgraphs (thresholds, asymptotic distributions)
 * Spectral method (graph Laplacian, graph cut interpretation, perturbation of
 eigenstructures)
 * Basic random matrix theory, pertubation theory
 * Semidefinite programming
 * Applications (Planted clique problem, community detection, graph matching,
 sorting and ranking)

### Prerequisites
Working knowledge of probability and linear algebra. No prior knowledge on graph
theory is assumed.

### Assessment scheme
* **Grading**: Homework 50% and paper reading 50% (presentations 20%, critical
  reviews 15%, in-class participation in discussing the paper 15%).
* **Homework assignment**: In the first half of the course, homework will be
  assigned every other week on Tuesday and due the Tuesday in two weeks. You are
  allowed, even encouraged, to work on the homework in small groups, but you
  must write up your own homework to hand in. **If you use materials other than
  the textbooks and lecture notes — this applies to having discussions with
  classmates or searching the Internet — please acknowledge the source
  clearly.**
* **Paper reading seminar**: The second half of the course will be paper reading
  seminars. One research paper will be discussed per lecture. Students work in
  groups. One group is responsible in thoroughly understanding the paper and
  giving a 40 min summary in class. Remaining groups write critical reviews of
  the paper before the lecture. Each lecture, there will be a presentation
  around an hour (40 min technical summary with questions during the
  presentation), followed by a 20 min discussion about limitations, comparisons,
  potential improvements, future directions of the paper.
    * Paper list and assignment will be provided.
    * Depending on registration numbers, each group presents 1 paper and writes
    critical reviews for the remaining papers (one review per group per paper).
    Guidance on how to structure a presentation and how to review a paper will
    be provided.
    * The presenting group is required to meet the instructor during office hour
    (or by appointment) to discuss the planned presentation at least two weeks
    before the lecture.
    * Both the presenting group and the reviewing groups should attend the paper
    reading seminars.
