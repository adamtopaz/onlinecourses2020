abstract: |
  This course will cover measure theoretic probability, random variables,
  expectation, product spaces, independence, derivatives, conditional probability,
  characteristic functions, and limit theorems. While rigorous proof is emphasized
  as the way to understand the material, the material is based on a course that
  has been taught to students in statistics, mathematics, engineering and science
  for many years. The proofs are elementary and build a foundation to learn how to
  conduct analysis. The close connection of measure and probability theory to
  computation and approximation are emphasized. The book covers the core
  material. It does not cover some standard advance topics, e.g., martingales,
  but (time permitting) does cover topics like disintegration and
  exchangeability that are important in applications.
  
  Course work will be based on homework assignments.
