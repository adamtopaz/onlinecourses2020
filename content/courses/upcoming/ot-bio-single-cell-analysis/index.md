# Course Abstract
# abstract : |
abstract: |
  The course covers foundational mathematical tools that are useful in analyzing
  high-dimensional single-cell datasets, and modelling developmental stochastic
  processes. We cover basic probability theory, statistical inference, convex
  optimization, Markov stochastic processes, and advanced topics in optimal
  transport.
