  In this course, we will explore both classic and current mathematical
  vignettes motivated by the biophysics of cell shape, cell motility, cell
  signaling, and pattern formation in mammalian cells. We will consider how
  cells interact with one another and how they coordinate into multicellular
  groups and tissues. From the mathematical perspective, we will showcase
  several important models (with applications beyond cell biology) where
  analysis provide insights and helps to understand underlying mechanisms. (We
  concentrate on ordinary and partial differential equations, i.e. deterministic
  models in this course.) We will see that models that prove useful in many
  other areas of science (ecology, population biology, social aggregation),
  suitably reinterpreted, can provide a foundation of understanding in the
  micro-world of cells. (Hence this course will also serve as a survey of PDEs
  that are important in STEM.) We also highlight several “classics of
  mathematical cell biology”, papers of recent vintage that have become
  influential or paradigm-shifting in modern cell biology. The course will
  include tutorials and hands-on exploration of the open source software,
  Morpheus, to simulate multiscale computational models of cells and tissue. The
  course will be based on a textbook, ``Mathematical Models for Cell Biology’’
  currently under development by the instructor, as well as papers from the
  literature.
