prerequisites:
  - |
    The course does not have formal prerequisites, but assumes background
    knowledge of linear algebra and calculus, including some degree of vector
    calculus, at the undergraduate engineering/physics level. Familiarity with
    the calculus of variations, as well as basic quantum mechanics, would also
    be helpful, but those are not formal requirements since the key necessary
    concepts will be presented. Some of the past students have not had a
    background in functionals and quantum mechanics, yet have been able to
    acquire the necessary background quickly and achieve high success in the
    course.

# Course Abstract
abstract : |
  This course provides an extensive theoretical foundation for as well as
  hands-on introduction to several widely used methods for studying the
  properties of materials and structures, in particular at the nanoscale and
  mesoscale. The majority of the time is spent on quantum-mechanical methods:
  the first-principles approaches (starting from the Hartree-Fock theory and
  building up to Configuration Interaction and the Møller–Plesset Perturbation
  Theory) and, in particular, the Density Functional Theory, which are derived
  and discussed in detail. Semi-empirical methods such as Tight Binding and
  Molecular Dynamics are also covered, as well as strategies for modelling
  material properties (electronic, mechanical, optical, etc.). Practical
  activities include implementing some of the above theories in computer code,
  in addition to using established software (Gaussian, SIESTA, VASP, LAMMPS,
  etc.). Each student also works on a project of their choice using the methods
  discussed.
