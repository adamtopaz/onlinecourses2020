# Course Abstract

abstract: |
  This is a basic level graduate course with introduction to algebraic topology
  and its applications in combinatorics, graph theory and geometry.  The course
  will cover introductory chapters from [1] and parts of [2].  Time permitting, we
  may touch some recent topics like the topology of random simplicial complexes.
  The instructor expects that students with interests in topology and those with
  interests in discrete mathematics and geometry would find the course suitable.

prerequisites:
  - Topological spaces
  - Continuous maps
  - Metric space topology
  - Quotient topology
  - Compactness
  - Basic notions about simplicial complexes, fundamental groups and covering spaces will be helpful, but students will also be given opportunity to self-study about these notions during the first month of the course and help will be offered during tutorials.
