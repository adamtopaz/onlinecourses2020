abstract: |
  Ergodic theory is the study of dynamical systems from a measurable or
  statistical point of view. Starting with Poincar√©'s recurrence theorem and the
  ergodic theorems of Birkoff and von Neumann ergodic theory in the early
  twentieth century. The field has applications to many other areas of mathematics
  including probability, number theory and harmonic analysis.  Among the topics
  covered will be
    *  examples of ergodic systems
    * the mean and pointwise ergodic theorems
    * mixing conditions
    * recurrence
    * entropy and
    * the Ornstein's Isomorphism Theorem.
