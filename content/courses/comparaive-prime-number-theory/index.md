# Course Abstract

abstract: |
  We will begin with a quick review of the prime number theorem and the "explicit
  formula", then develop the theory of Dirichlet characters, and combine these two
  sets of tools to prove the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions. We
  will then move into comparing two counting functions of primes in arithmetic
  progressions, going through the history of such comparisons and learning how the
  normalized difference can be modeled by random variables, thus giving us a way
  to understand its limiting distribution. Student assessment will consist of some
  modest combination of presentations and reviews of research articles.
  Recommended prerequisites are a solid course (preferably graduate-level) in
  elementary number theory, and a graduate-level course in analytic number theory,
  one that included a proof of the prime number theorem and the corresponding
  explicit formula. An undergraduate course in probability would also be helpful.
  Reference texts would be standard analytic number theory books by Iwaniec &
  Kowalski, by Montgomery & Vaughan, and by Titchmarsh. Students who are willing
  to learn some of this background as they go are welcome. Classes will be held
  live (synchronously) on Zoom and regular attendance will be important. The
  current tentative schedule is to meet at 10am Pacific time on Mondays and
  Wednesdays and possibly Fridays. Students can join from any physical location.
