  The course is a first semester in algebraic topology. Broadly speaking,
  algebraic topology studies the shape of spaces by assigning algebraic invariants
  to them. Topics will include the fundamental group, covering spaces, CW
  complexes, homology (simplicial, singular, cellular), cohomology, and some
  applications.
