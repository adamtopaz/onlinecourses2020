abstract: |
  Vertex algebras are algebraic structures formed by the vertex operators that
  appear both in mathematics and in physics. In mathematics, vertex algebras are
  used to study the Monster group, the largest finite simple group. The
  representation theory of vertex algebras gives a mathematical construction to
  two-dimensional conformal field theories. In this course, we will take an
  axiomatic approach and focus on the definition, axioms, properties and examples.
  If time permits, we will also introduce the theory of vertex tensor categories
  associated to the modules for the vertex operator algebras.
