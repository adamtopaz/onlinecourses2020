  We will cover classical and modern methods of experimental design starting with
  one-way ANOVA and Cochran’s Theorem. From there, we will consider multi-factor
  ANOVA using a variety of combinatorial tools such as Graeco-Latin squares and
  incomplete block designs. There will be a brief interlude on multiple testing
  followed by 2 and 3 level factorial designs, fractional factorial designs, and
  blocking within such designs. Then, response surface designs—i.e. quadratic
  polynomial surfaces used for optimization of industrial processes–will be
  discussed. Lastly, more advanced topics will be touched on such as prime-level
  factorial designs and the Plackett-Burman design, which involves Hadamard
  matrices. Interesting datasets, connections to optimal coding theory, and
  at-home experiments will also be discussed. For study purposes, discussion
  questions will be included with the lectures and solutions will be discussed in
  class.

* **Course Prerequisites:**
  * Linear Algebra: vectors, matrices, quadratic forms, orthogonality, projections, eigenvalues.
  * Calculus: basic multivariate differential calculus such as computing gradients and finding critical points.
  * Statistics: an understanding of estimation and hypothesis testing, knowledge of linear regression is helpful.
  * Discrete Math: familiarity with topics like basic group theory and combinatorics can help, but are not required
