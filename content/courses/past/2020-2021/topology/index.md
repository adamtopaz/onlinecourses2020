# Course Abstract

abstract: |
 The official title 'Topology' of this course is misleading. A better one would be 'Topics in Dynamical
 Systems'. Dynamical systems is the mathematical study of models based on the
 idea of a topological space, representing the possible configurations of a
 system and a continuous map (or maps) which represent its time evolution. The
 systems considered in this course have two additional features: the space is
 compact and totally disconnected while the map is minimal in the sense that
 every trajectory formed by iteration on a single point is dense. Such spaces
 have a strongly combinatorial feel to them and one of our main goals is o
 provide a complete model for such systems based purely on combinatorial data
 called a Bratteli diagram. This model has been used extensively in topological
 dynamics over the last thirty years. The second main topic is to introduce a
 purely algebraic invariant for such systems. So the course becomes an
 interesting mix, moving between combinatorics, algebra and topology or
 dynamical systems. The overall goal is a theorem which classifies such systems
 up to a notion of orbit equivalence. Primarily, we will aim to understand all
 of the ingredients for the theorem and have some idea of how to prove it.

### Textbook

The text is the book Cantor MInimal Systems, written by the lecturer and
published by the AMS:

* [https://bookstore.ams.org/ulect-70](https://bookstore.ams.org/ulect-70)

It is my intention to cover all 14 Chapters, at least partially.


### Grading Scheme
The grading scheme for the course will be six assignments, due roughly every two
weeks.  They will be weighted equally and the lowest score will be dropped
before computing a final grade. There will be no tests. Students will be
expected to submit their own work only, but may feel free to discuss the
problems with others.


### Schedule
The course will be online: lectures Monday and Thursday from 11:30 am to 12:50
pm. I intend to use the first part of each lecture as a discussion for the
entire class. Depending on how long these take, it may be necessary to
supplement the material with recorded (i.e. asynchronous) lectures.
