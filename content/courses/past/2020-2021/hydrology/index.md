  The University of Saskatchewan Centre for Hydrology is offering an intensive
  course on the fundamentals of process-based hydrological modelling, including
  model development, model application, and model evaluation. The course will
  explain the model constructs that are necessary to simulate dominant
  hydrological processes, the assumptions that are embedded in models of different
  type and complexity, and best practices for model development and model
  applications. The course will cover the full model ecosystem, including the
  spatial discretization of the model domain, input forcing data generation, model
  evaluation, parameter estimation, post-processing, uncertainty characterization,
  data assimilation, and ensemble streamflow forecasting methods. The overall
  intent of the course is to provide participants with the understanding and tools
  that are necessary to develop and apply models across a broad range of
  landscapes. Specifically, the course will convey an understanding of how to
  represent existing process understanding in numerical models, how to devise
  meaningful model experiments, and how to evaluate these experiments in a
  systematic way. Along the way, participants will have the opportunity to build
  models, run models, make changes, and analyze model output.

prerequisites:
  - A firm foundation in calculus and physics at the first year university level
  - Some experience in computing (e.g. Familiarity with python, R, matlab)
  - A strong background in hydrology e.g. As obtained by taking Geography 827
    "Principles of Hydrology" at the University of Saskatchewan or a similar
    graduate-level course in hydrology.
