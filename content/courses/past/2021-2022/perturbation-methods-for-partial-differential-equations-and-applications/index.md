abstract: |
  This is a course in modern techniques in applied mathematics, focusing on
  perturbation methods for partial differential equations. The material provides
  valuable skills and resources complementary to scientific computations,
  mathematical modeling in applications, analysis of PDEâ€™s and dynamical systems.
  The general concepts and methods are illustrated and developed for a wide
  variety of specific problems arising in math biology, fluid mechanics, materials
  science, and wave propagation.

prerequisites:
- Students should have a working knowledge of Applied PDE (such as MATH 400 at
  UBC), a basic Complex Variables Course (such as M300 at UBC), and preferably
  the course M550 at UBC on an introduction to perturbation theory. Some
  experience with mathematical modeling in either continuum mechanics or biology
  is also desirable.
