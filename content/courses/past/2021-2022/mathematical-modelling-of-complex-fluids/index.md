  This course will give students an overview of Non-Newtonian Fluid Dynamics, and
  discuss two approaches to building constitutive models for complex fluids:
  continuum modeling and kinetic- microstructural modeling. In addition, it will
  provide an introduction to multiphase complex fluids and to numerical models and
  algorithms for computing complex fluid flows.
