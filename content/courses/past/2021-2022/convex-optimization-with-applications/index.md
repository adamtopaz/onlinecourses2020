  The main goal of the course is to equip students with practical modeling and
  computational skills needed to solve optimization problems arising in various
  applications, with major emphasis on the so-called convex optimization. Some
  theoretical aspects of convex optimization will be covered. Roughly half of the
  course will be dedicated to modeling techniques and optimization software. A
  particular emphasis will be made on CVX package: Matlab Software for
  [Disciplined Convex Programming](http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvx/).

  At the end of the course (MATH661: Convex Optimization) the students will be
  able to

  * Define constrained optimization problem,
  * Define convex optimization problem,
  * Test Euclidean subsets for convexity,
  * Test univariate (not necessarily differentiable) functions for convexity,
  * Define and recognize basic sub-types of convex optimization problems, such
    as least-squares, linear programming, QP, QCQP, SOCP, and possibly SDP,
  * Give concrete examples of convex optimization applications in areas like
    statistical estimation (MLE), math finance (portfolio optimization),
    approximation of hard combinatorial problems (boolean LP relaxation), etc.
  * Convert and solve exemplary (real-world) word problems into abstract convex
    programs, and use MATLAB/Python CVX environment to solve the problems above.
