abstract: |
  MATH 560 provides a broad overview of Mathematical Biology at an introductory
  level. The scope is obviously subject to the limitations of time and instructor
  knowledge and interests - this is a HUGE area of research.
  
  It is intended for early stage math bio grad students, general applied math grad
  students interested in finding out more about biology applications, and grad
  students in other related departments interested in getting some mathematical
  and computational modelling experience.
  
  The course is organized around a sample of topics in biology that have seen a
  significant amount of mathematical modelling over the years. Currently, I’m
  including content from ecology, evolution and evolutionary game theory,
  epidemiology, biochemistry and gene regulation, cell biology, electrophysiology,
  developmental biology. However, this list changes gradually from year to year,
  to reflect students’ and my own interests. The mathematical modelling methods
  and techniques covered are those that typically arise in the biological
  applications listed above. For example, I will cover models using ordinary and
  partial differential equations, stochastic processes, agent-based models and
  introduce techniques from bifurcation theory, asymptotics, dimensional analysis,
  numerical solution methods, and parameter estimation. An emphasis will be placed
  on reading and discussing classic and current papers.
