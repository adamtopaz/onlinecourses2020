abstract: |
  We will be exploring topics in extremal combinatorics from problems for set
  systems to graph theory and hypergraphs. These include extremal results for
  chains and antichains, intersecting set systems, isoperimetric problems,
  extremal numbers for graphs, extremal properties of matchings, extremal numbers
  for small hypergraphs, graph eigenvalues, extremal problems for graph diameter,
  distance transitive graphs, and some extremal results from combinatorial
  matrix theory.
  
  A more detailed list of topics is available in the preliminary syllabus.
