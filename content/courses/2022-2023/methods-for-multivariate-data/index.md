prerequisites:
  - For STAT 475-3, undergraduates must have completed 3 credit hours of linear
    algebra (equivalent to UNBC MATH 150-3 or UNBC MATH 220-3) and 3 credit
    hours of linear modelling (UNBC STAT 471-3). There are no formal
    prerequisites for STAT 673-3 as a graduate student enrolling without the
    undergraduate pre-requisites must be prepared to make up any deficiencies in
    linear algebra, probability, statistics, and statistical linear modelling.

# Course Abstract

  This course discusses practical techniques for the analysis of multivariate
  data. Topics covered include estimation and hypothesis testing for
  multivariate means and variances; partial, multiple and canonical
  correlations; principal components analysis and factor analysis for data
  reduction; multivariate analysis of variance; discriminant analysis; and
  cluster analysis.
