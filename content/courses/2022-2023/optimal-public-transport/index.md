# Course Abstract

  The goal of this course is to teach the students to use mathematical models to
  improve and optimize public transport networks. The first part of the course
  is about using Markov Chains and dealing with big amount of public transport
  data. The students will learn how to use Markov Chains to model public
  transport networks, and how to validate the model by using the data. Important
  quantitates that can be extracted from the transition matrix of the Markov
  Chains will be studied with their related theorems. These quantities will be
  used to improve and optimize the network. The second part of the course is
  about using Linear Optimization in Public Transport Delay Management.
  Different Delay Management problems such as delay management problem with
  fixed connections, total delay management problem, bicriteria delay management
  problem, and general delay management problem will be studied. Especially
  perturbed timetables will be discussed and two integer programming
  descriptions of the set of all feasible perturbed timetables will be given.
  The first one is based on the “intuitive” description of the problem, while
  the second one uses the concept of event-activity networks. Assignment: The
  students should submit and present a project with some computer programming
  tasks for this course. They should use SUMO, Simulator of Urban Mobility, to
  simulate the public transport network and extract the data. They need to
  import the data extracted from the simulation to MATLAB or Python and
  implement the Markov Chain and Linear Optimization models. Guest lecturers:
  There will be two or three guest lecturers for this course Professor Robert
  Shorten from Imperial College London, Dr Emanuele Crisostomi from University
  of Pizza, and/or Professor Tarek Sayed from University of British Columbia.
  Grading: Assignment (Project presentation): 40% Midterm 1: 15% Midterm 2: 15%
  Final: 30% Required Reading: • Optimization in Public Transportation, Springer

  big-data model for multi-modal public transportation with application to
  macroscopic control and optimization, International Journal of Control, vol.
  88, Issue. 11, pp. 1-28, 2015 The course can be presented remotely. The
  recorded lectures are going to be posted.
