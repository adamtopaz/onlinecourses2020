  This is a one semester three credit hour course. It is about the theory and
  applications of stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motion. A
  stochastic differential equation (SDE) is a differential equation in which the
  rate of change is determined by the state of the system itself, some external
  known forces and some unknown external forces as well. The noise in the system
  is given by random white noise calculated as the derivative of Brownian motion
  or the Wiener process. However, other types of random behaviour are possible,
  such as jump processes. Random differential equations are conjugate to
  stochastic differential equations. This course will concentrate on stochastic
  differential equations driven by Brownian motions. The stochastic differential
  equations are used to model various phenomena such as unstable stock prices or
  physical systems subject to thermal fluctuations. They have found applications
  in finance, signal processing, population dynamics and many other fields. It
  is the basis of some other applied probability areas such as filtering theory,
  stochastic control and stochastic differential games. To balance the
  theoretical and applied aspects and to include as much audience as possible,
  we shall focus on the stochastic differential equations driven only by
  Brownian motion (white noise). We will focus on the theory and not get into
  specic applied area (finance, signal processing, filtering, control and so
  on). We shall first briefly introduce some basic concepts and results on
  stochastic processes, in particular, the Brownian motions. Then we will
  discuss stochastic integrals, Ito formula, the existence and uniqueness of
  stochastic differential equations, some fundamental properties of the
  solution. We will concern with the Markov property, Kolmogorov backward and
  forward equations, Feynman-Kac formula, Girsanov formula. We will also concern
  with the ergodic theory and other stability problems. We may also mention some
  results on numerical simulations, Malliavin calculus and so on.
