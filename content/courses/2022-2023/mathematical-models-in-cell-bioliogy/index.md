# Course Abstract
abstract: |
  Cell biology provides many interesting challenges across many spatial scales.
  Mathematical and computational modeling are tools that can help gain a better
  understanding of cellular phenomena. At the small scales, there are puzzling
  examples of patterns formed by proteins inside cells, and dynamic
  rearrangement of cellular components that enable cells to actively move. At
  higher scales, cells sense chemical gradients, exhibit active motility, and
  interact with other cells to form functioning tissues and organs. Mathematical
  and computational models allow us to explore many of the leading questions at
  each of these levels. How do patterns form spontaneously? What are the limits
  of cell sensing? How do cells polarize and migrate in a directed manner? How
  does a collection of cells self-organize into a structured tissue? In this
  graduate course, we will explore such questions in the context of
  deterministic models (ordinary and partial differential equations) as well as
  stochastic simulations that emphasize multiscale approaches.


  The course is designed to be equally suitable for mathematics graduate
  students looking to learn advanced modeling methods, interesting applications,
  and topics for further analysis, and biologists who want to understand and
  critically assess models and carry out advanced multiscale simulations.  All
  participants will learn multiscale simulations (using the open source software
  Morpheus) to visualize behaviour that emerges from intracellular signaling
  systems, cell migration, and cell-cell interactions. An emphasis will be on
  communication across disciplines, matching students from distinct disciplines
  for joint  presentations and projects. Learning goals, expectations,
  assignments, and grading will take into account the student background.
