# Course Abstract
# abstract : |
abstract: |
  The course is a first semester of algebraic topology. Broadly speaking,
  algebraic topology studies spaces and shapes by assigning algebraic invariants
  to them. Topics will include the fundamental group, covering spaces, CW
  complexes, homology (simplicial, singular, cellular), cohomology, and some
  applications.
