  Classifying spaces of algebraic groups do not exist in classical algebraic
  geometry. However, they can be approximated by algebraic varieties. Using this
  approach, Burt Totaro defined the Chow ring CH(BG) of algebraic cycles on the
  classifying space BG of an affine algebraic group G. The representation ring
  R(G) can be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of BG. It turns out that the rings
  CH(BG) and R(G) are related the same way as the Chow ring and the Grothendieck
  ring of a smooth algebraic variety are. Namely, for elements of R(G) one can
  define their Chern classes with values in CH(BG). And there is a surjective
  ring homomorphism of CH(BG) onto the graded ring associated with certain
  filtration on R(G). We discuss these and related objects, consider examples of
  their computation, review some applications. We also take a look at the
  rationality problem of BG. We start with a quick introduction into algebraic
  groups and into the theory of Chow rings of algebraic varieties.
