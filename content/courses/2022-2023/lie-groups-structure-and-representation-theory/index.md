    As a graduate course there are no strict pre-requisites, but course is
    easier to follow for students with a general graduate background including
    real analysis and point-set topology, functional analysis, some algebra, and
    undergraduate group theory and linear algebra. Specific background: while we
    will develop the notion of a Lie algebra from scratch as well as the theory
    of roots, weights, etc, the course will be easier going for students who
    have seen previously seen Lie algebras and the classification of complex
    (semi)simple Lie algebras, such as in MATH 534.

  The course will discuss the structure and representation theory of real Lie
  groups. It will be roughly divided into four parts: 1. Topological groups,
  introduction to representation theory, and the Peter–Weyl Theorem. 2. Lie
  groups: basic definitions and differential geometry 3. Compact Lie groups:
  maximal tori, roots and weights, representation theory, Weyl character and
  integration formulae. 4. Real Lie groups: Lie algebras,
  Poincare–Birkhoff–Witt, Cartan subalgebras, roots and weights, parabolic
  subgroups, introduction to infinite-dimensional representations.
