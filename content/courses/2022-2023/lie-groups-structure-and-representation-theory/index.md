  - |
    There will be no formal pre-requisites.  Ideally students would have a
    general graduate background including real analysis and integration, point
    set topology, and functional analysis.  Familiarity with the classification
    of complex semisimple Lie algebras (e.g. by taking UBC MATH 534) would be an
    advantage.

# Course Abstract

abstract: |
  This is a graduate course on the structure and representation theory of real
  Lie groups. The course will have four parts: an introduction to topological
  and compact groups, the basics of Lie groups and differential geometry, the
  structure and representation theory of compact Lie groups, and (as time
  allows) the structure and representation theory of semisimple Lie groups.
