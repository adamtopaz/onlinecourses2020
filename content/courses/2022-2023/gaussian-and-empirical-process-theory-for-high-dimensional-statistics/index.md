prerequisites:
  - The course assumes that the students have a taken classes in advanced
    theoretical statistics comparable to PhD level courses STAT 581, 582, 583 at
    University of Washington. Some knowledge of measure theoretic probability
    will be helpful, too.

# Course Abstract

abstract: |
  In this course we develop elements of the theory of Gaussian and empirical
  processes that have proved useful for statistical inference in
  high-dimensional models, i.e. statistical models in which the number of
  parameters is much larger than the sample size. The course consists of three
  parts, with the first two parts laying the foundation for the third one: an
  introduction to modern techniques in Gaussian processes, a recap of empirical
  classical process theory emphasizing weak convergence on metric spaces, and
  lastly, a discussion of Gaussian approximation, high-dimensional CLTs, and the
  conditional multiplier bootstrap.

  #### Course Contents:
    - Part 1: Elements of Gaussian processes (concentration,
  comparison, anti-concentration, and super-concentration inequalities,
  Talagrand’s Generic chaining bounds).
    - Part 2: Elements of empirical processes
  (convergence of laws on separable metric spaces, Glivenko-Cantelli and Donsker
  theorems under metric and bracketing entropy, applications to bootstrap) 
    - Part 3: A selection of theoretical problems in high-dimensional inference
      (including
  but not limited to Gaussian approximation, high-dimensional CLTs, and
  multiplier bootstrap when function classes are not Donsker).

#### Homework and Examinations

There will be regular homework assignments and an oral examination. The oral
examination will work as follows: The lecture will be divided in roughly ten
topics which will be shared with the students ahead of time. At the day of the
examination the students will randomly draw two topics and give two 10-15 min
presentations on their topics on the blackboard (no prepared notes allowed).
Each presentation will conclude with ca. 5 minutes of follow-up questions.
Textbooks for the first and second part: 

  - Dudley, R.  M.  (2014). "Uniform Central Limit Theorems". CUP. 
  - Giné, E. and Nickl, R.  (2016).  "Mathematical Foundations of Infinite-Dimensional Statistical Models".  CUP. 
  - van der Vaart, A. and Wellner, J. (1996). "Weak Convergence and Empirical
    Processes". Springer.

Typed lecture notes of all three parts will be provided.

_Please note, the WDA registration deadline for this course at UBC will be **Jan
6th, 2023.**_
