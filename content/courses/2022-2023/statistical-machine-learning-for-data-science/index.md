# Course Abstract
# abstract : |
abstract: |
  Based on a mathematical and statistical theory foundation, the course
  introduces statistical methods for supervised and unsupervised learning,
  focusing on hands-on skills with the statistical software, R, and applications
  to real data. The course covers re-sampling methods, regression and
  classification, tree-based methods, dimension reduction, and clustering. It
  embeds R training through the entire class. Additional information for this
  course: I will have at least four graduate students from Mathematics and
  Statistics, the University of Victoria, interested in registering for this
  course. And this course is also one of the popular courses offered in my
  department at the University of Saskatchewan.
