# Course Abstract

abstract: |
  This is a first course in analytic number theory. In this course we will focus
  on the theory of the Riemann zeta function and of prime numbers. The goal of
  this course will include proving explicit bounds for the number $\pi(x)$ of
  primes which are less than a given number $x$.  Building analytical tools to
  prove the prime number theorem (PNT) will be at the core of this course. We
  will explore and compare explicit formulas, whether they are using smooth
  weights or a truncated Perron formula, to relate averages over primes and
  $\pi(x)$ to sums over the zeros of zeta. Another originality of this course
  will be to explore each topic explicitly (essentially by computing all the
  hidden terms implied in the asymptotic estimates). With this respect, students
  will get an introduction to relevant programming languages and computational
  software. This will be closely connected to Analytic Number Theory 2 proposed
  by Greg Martin (UBC), as the sequences of topics are coordinated between us;
  the intention is for students at all PIMS institutions to be able to take the
  second analytic number theory course as a continuation of the first one with
  maximum benefit. In addition, these two courses will provide excellent
  training for students who plan to attend the "Inclusive Paths in Explicit
  Number Theory" CRG summer school in 2023. All these events are part of the
  PIMS CRG L-functions in Analytic Number Theory" 2022-2015.
