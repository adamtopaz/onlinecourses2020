prerequisites:
  - A course in analytic number theory that includes Dirichlet series and a
    complex-analytic proof of the prime number theorem (preferably [Analytic
    Number Theory I](/#currentcourses) taught by Kadiri in Fall 2022), or other
    exposure to those topics

# Course Abstract
# abstract : |
abstract: |
  This course is a second graduate course in number theory, designed to follow
  [Analytic Number Theory I](/#currentcourses ) taught by Prof. Habiba Kadiri
  (University of Lethbridge) in Fall 2022. We will learn about Dirichlet
  characters and sums involving them, Dirichlet _L_-functions and their zeros,
  and the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions. With the explicit
  formula for the error term in this theorem, we will continue into limiting
  distributions of error terms and comparative prime number theory ("prime
  number races"). This course also precedes the summer school "Inclusive Paths
  in Explicit Number Theory" in Summer 2023 and is designed to give students the
  ideal preparation for that summer school program. All three of these events
  are part of the current [PIMS CRG "_L_-functions in Analytic Number
  Theory" (2022-2025)](https://sites.google.com/view/crgl-functions/crg-news).
