# Course Abstract

abstract: |
  Much of our understanding of evolution, the process shaping the beautiful
  biological diversity in our world, is grounded in equally elegant mathematics.
  In this course we will cover the mathematical description of evolution.
  Involving a wide range of topics, from the analysis of non-linear dynamics to
  stochastic processes and partial differential equations, this course will
  challenge you to take mathematical principals and apply them to the natural
  world. Throughout this course we will focus particularly on addressing
  important contemporary existential questions with mathematical models, for
  example applications of evolution to conservation and public health.
