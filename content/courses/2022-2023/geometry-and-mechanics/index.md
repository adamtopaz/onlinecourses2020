# Course Abstract

abstract: |
  This course offers a concise, but self-contained, introduction to the subject
  of mechanics, which combines geometrical view and physical insights. We will
  start with a formulation of classical mechanics in the framework of
  variational principles, translate from point to continuous systems, and
  analyze the effects of holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. The discussion
  of effects of friction and collision will naturally lead us to ergodic theory.
  A significant part of the course will be devoted to the geometric language of
  mechanics including analysis on manifolds, Lie groups, and differential
  topology. Among its applications, we will focus on symmetries, reduction, and
  geometric phase both in finite and infinite dimensions including fluid
  mechanics. Two key references which define the spirit of the course are
  "Lectures on Mechanics" by Jerrold Marsden and "Mathematical Methods of
  Classical Mechanics" by Vladimir Arnold.
