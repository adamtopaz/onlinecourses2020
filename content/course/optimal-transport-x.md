This course has two main objectives: first, to introduce a wide range of
students to the exciting and broadly applicable research area of optimal
transport, and second, to explore more closely its applications in a particular
field, which will vary from year to year. Optimal transport is the general
problem of moving one distribution of mass to another as efficiently as
possible (for example, think of using a pile of dirt to fill a hole of the same
volume, so as to minimize the average distance moved). This basic problem has a
wealth of applications within mathematics (in PDE, geometry, functional
analysis, probability, ...) as well as in other fields (comparing images in image
processing, comparing and interpolating between data sets in statistics,
matching partners in economics, aligning electrons in chemical physicsâ€¦) and is
currently an extremely active research area.

The first part of the course surveys the basic theory of optimal transport.
Topics covered include: formulation of the problem, Kantorovich duality theory,
existence and uniqueness theory, c-monotonicity and structure of solutions,
discrete optimal transport. The exact choice of topics may vary slightly from
year to year, to ensure compatibility with 'X'.

The second part of the course develops applications in a particular area
(represented by 'X' in the title), which rotates from year to year. Topics when
'X' = "economics" (presented here as a model) would include a selection of
topics from: I) Econometrics: estimation, indentification, testability.  II)
Theory: contract theory (matching, hedonic problems), industrial organization
(screening problems), game theory (connections with mean field games )

In both parts, we aim to keep the presentation accessible to non-experts.
