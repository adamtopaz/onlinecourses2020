This course will give students an overview of Non-Newtonian Fluid Dynamics, and
discuss two approaches to building constitutive models for complex fluids:
continuum modeling and kinetic- microstructural modeling. In addition, it will
provide an introduction to multiphase complex fluids and to numerical models and
algorithms for computing complex fluid flows. 

1. Introduction
  * Background and motivation
  * Review of required mathematics
2. Continuum theories
  * Oldroyd’s theory for viscoelastic fluids
  * Ericksen-Leslie theory for liquid crystals • Viscoplastic theories
3. Kinetic-microstructural theories
  * Dumbbell theory for polymer solutions
  * Bead-rod-chain theories
  * Doi-Edwards theory for entangled systems 
  * Doi theory for liquid crystalline materials
4. Heterogeneous/multiphase systems
  * Suspension theories (Einstein, Taylor, Batchelor, etc.) • Kinetic theory for
emulsions and drop dynamics
  * Energetic formalism for interfacial dynamics
  * Numerical methods for moving boundary problems
5. Applications
  * Polymer processing
  * Sedimentation and Fluidization
  * Bio-materials and processes: Pattern formation and self-assembly 
  * Others (gels, surfactants, colloids, Marangoni flows, etc.)
