After the global financial crisis in 2008 there has been a growing need for
fully trained financial risk forecasters, which involves 

1. Statistical modeling and forecasting
1. Data analytics
1. Deep learning techniques
1. Computing skills for Statistics, Computer Science and basic Finance.

The purpose of this new course is to expose graduate and senior undergraduate
students to challenging new opportunities for learning fundamentals of financial
risk forecasting for decision- making in modern businesses. The curriculum is
designed to grasp fundamental Statistical, Financial and Risk forecasting
concepts and models that are needed to make sound decisions in steering an
organization’s future prospects adapting to the current day needs. It is
intended (a) for students in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science as well
as Business and Finance to familiarize a part of “world of modern
finance/business markets”; (b) to understand the underlying
Mathematics/Statistics concepts to develop algorithms for forecasting financial
risk. This course will help students understand the root(s) of the problem(s)
and methodologies to analyze these problems. The statistical and computational
methodologies have advanced to a large extent and systematically developed to
help them understand the complex concepts.

The learning outcome from this course will include (i) first-hand experience on
financial risk forecasting by formulating financial problems into computational
problems and implementing them in normal and state-of-the-art computing
environments; (ii) strong expertise on a spectrum of quantitative techniques to
solve risk management problems; and (iii) stilling strong confidence in students
in applying their knowledge to a new and still unfamiliar field for them.
