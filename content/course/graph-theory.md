The Fall 2021 offering of Math 827, Graph Theory will on algebraic techniques in
graph theory. The focus will be on spectral graph theory, adjacency matrices and
eigenvalues of graphs. We will consider graph homomorphism and automorphisms of
graphs. We will study transitive graphs and examine several examples of
important families of transitive graphs where algebraic methods are particularly
effective. The course will include an introduction to strongly regular graphs
and association schemes. We will look at applications, such as extremal problems
on these graphs.

This class will include a 3 week unit on Cayley graphs, taught by Dr. Joy Morris
from the University of Lethbridge. There will also be a 3 week unit on Ramsey
theory and random graphs taught by Dr Karen Gunderson from the University of
Manitoba.
