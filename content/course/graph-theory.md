The Fall 2021 offering of Math 827, Graph Theory  will consist of three units on
advanced graph theory topics.

The first unit will be 6 weeks will be on algebraic techniques in graph theory
taught by Dr. Karen Meagher of the University of Regina.  The focus will be on
spectral graph theory, adjacency matrices and eigenvalues of graphs. We will
consider important families of transitive graphs where algebraic methods are
particularly effective.

The second unit will be 3 weeks on Cayley graphs, taught by Dr. Joy Morris from
the University of Lethbridge. This unit will focus on automorphisms,
isomorphisms and the isomorphism problem, and Hamilton cycles, all in the
context of Cayley graphs.

The third unit will be 3 weeks on the topic of random graphs taught by Dr Karen
Gunderson from the University of Manitoba.  This unit will cover various models
of random graphs and some types of pseudorandomness.
